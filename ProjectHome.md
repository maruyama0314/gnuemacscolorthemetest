# Notes #

Please be patient when you load these pages. They have a lot of `iframe`s and so it can take some time to get them downloaded and rendered.

Also, you want to use a modern browser like the latest version of Mozilla Firefox for best experience. I have tested these pages using Firefox version 3.5.

To generated these pages, I used version 1.16 of [htmlize.el](http://fly.srk.fer.hr/~hniksic/emacs/htmlize.el) to generate the html files inside the `iframe`s. The Perl script that I use to generate them is in the Subversion repository.

I also maintain a similar project for Vim [here](http://code.google.com/p/vimcolorschemetest/).

# Color Themes #

The color themes used in this page are available in this Emacs Wiki [page](http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ColorTheme).

The actual `color-theme.el` I used is version 6.6.0 and I put a copy of it [here](http://gnuemacscolorthemetest.googlecode.com/files/color-theme-6.6.0-mav.zip) for the record. As a side benefit, this zip file contains compiled elisp files (.elc) and I imagine they could be useful to some.

Fellow Emacs users: _Please_ contribute to the color-theme package if you have come up with an authentic color theme of your own. You can submit a patch at the [color-theme library](http://www.nongnu.org/color-theme/) page.
